#Contributing To Opkit

First of all, thank you for helping to contribute to this repository! Here are just a few things to keep in mind as you are doing so.

##Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct:  http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/. By participating,
you are expected to uphold this code.

##Reporting Bugs

For reporting a bug with existing code, open a new issue. If you are unsure how to do this, visit: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/.

Be sure to keep your issue titles and descriptions as concise as possible.

##New Features

Keep in mind that Opkit is a devops bot framework for Slack. If the feature you want to include does not fall into this category, it will likely not be accepted. That being said, if you are planning to work on a substantial feature, be sure to contact us first (preferrably through a github issue) and let us know that you are planning on doing so -- this way you won't waste time working on a feature that may never get approved.

Once you're done coding up a new feature, simply submit a new pull request. Again, be sure to keep these descriptive and concise.
Travis will automatically trigger a build and let you know whether you've broken anything. We enforce 100 percent code coverage 
for this repository -- that means that every line of code that you have written is being tested appropriately. Note that we will not
accept any pull requests which break the build on Travis.
